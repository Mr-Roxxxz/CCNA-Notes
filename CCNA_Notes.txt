What is a Network?
A Compute Network is a digital telecommunications network which allows nodes to share resources
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network#:~:text=A%20computer%20network%20is%20a,provided%20by%20the%20network%20nodes.)

What is a Node?
A node can be numerous types of networking devices, including; 
- Firewalls
- Routers
- Switches
- Servers
- Clients

Describing different types of nodes
Firewalls are a specialty Networking device that controls the ingress and egress on a network
		- Protect end-hosts inside the network
		- Make decisions based on pre-configured rule sets
		- Can be placed inside or outside of a network
		- Can be software based (Win Defender) or Hardware based appliances
		- Can be Network or Host based.

Routers are used to provide connectivity between different Local Area Networks (LAN)
		- Used to send Data over the internet
		- Generally have fewer interfaces than a switch
		
Switches are used to connect multiple end point devices within a single LAN
		- do not provide connectivity over the internet
		- Have many connections available for endpoint connectivity. 
		
Servers are a device that offers service or resources to a Client

Clients are devices that access resources or services from a server.


## Interfaces and Cables

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieTH5lVhNaY&list=PLxbwE86jKRgMpuZuLBivzlM8s2Dk5lXBQ&index=4

Interface Types:
RJ-45 - (RJ = Registered Jack) Used on the end of a Copper Ethernet Cable
Ethernet- Collection of Network protocols and standards 
		- Transferred in Bits and Bytes. 
			- Typically measured in bits
			- 1000 bits = 1Kb
			- 1000Kb = 1 Mb
			- 1000Mb = 1 Gb
			- 1000Gb = 1 Tb

IEEE Standards for Ethernet 


Typically uses UTP - Unsheilded Twisted Pair cables
		- Twist helps protect against EMI

10Base- T and 100Base- T 
**Only use 2 Pairs (4 wires)


Straight Through Cables

| 1 --------- 1 |  --------  TX to Send
| 2 --------- 2 | -------- TX to Send
| 3 --------- 3 |  -------- RX to Receive
| 4 xxxxx 4 |
| 5 xxxxx 5 |
|6 ---------- 6 |  -------- RX to Receive

Cross-Over Cables

| 1 ----x--- 3 |
| 2 ----x--- 6 |
| 3 ----x--- 1 |
| 4 xxxxx 4 |
| 5 xxxxx 5 |
| 6 ----x--- 2 |

Device TX and RX Chart 



Auto- MDIX
- Allows devices to automatically detect TX and switch to be compatible with PIN config

1000Base -t and 10G Base-T
**Uses all 4 pairs (8 Wires)

Each Pair is Bi-Directional - Allows 1 wire to send and 1 to receive

Fibre Optics Connection
Uses an SFP receiver to allow Fibre capabilities 
		- 1 wire transmits, 1 wire receives
		
Cable contains
1. Glass Core
2. Cladding (to reflect light)
3. Buffer (protection)
4. Outer Jacket

Fiber Modes
Single Mode - Core is thinner, Light enters at single angle.
			- Longest of cable types
			- Uses laser (rather than LED), hence more $$
			
Multi Mode- Core is much larger, allows multiple angles of waves to enter core.
			- Allows longer cable than UTP but shorter than Single Mode
			- Cheaper than Single Mode, cheaper material (uses LED)
			
IEEE Standards for Fiber


Useful Acronyms for Fiber

LX = Local OR (e)Xternal
SR = Short Range
LR = Long Range
ER = Extended Range






## TCP/IP and OSI Model
Jeremy's IT Lab- Video 6:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-ai8JzhHuY&list=PLxbwE86jKRgMpuZuLBivzlM8s2Dk5lXBQ&index=6

What is a Networking Model
Networking Models categorizer and provide structure for networking Protocols and standards

OSI Model
Open Systems Interconnection Model
Invented by ISO in 70's and 80's
7 Layer model that represents the way data navigates throughout the network

Layers
1. Physical
2. Data Link
3. Network
4. Transport
5. Session
6. Presentation
7. Application

- Physical Layer includes Cables, Interface Cards, and Radio Waves
- Data Link Layer provides MAC Addesses to the data
- Network Layer is where IP's are assigned 
- Transport Layer is where protocols are assigned (TCP/IP)
- Session Layer is where communication is controlled. (Manages applications and communicatio)
- Presentation Layer Translates the Network data into Human readable data
- Application Layer is the program used to produce the Data


TCP/IP Suite
More Modern than OSI, Delveloped by DoD (DARPA)
Only 4 layers (as opposed to 7 in OSI)

1. Link
2. Internet
3. Transport
4. Application

Link Layer replaces BOTH the Physical and Data Link layer in OSI model
Internet Layer is equal to the Network Layer in OSI Model
Transport Layer is the same as OSI Model
Application LAyer combines Session, Presentation and Application Layer from OSI Model.

**OSI is most commonly referred to**
Network Engineers focus on Network and below
Application Developers focus on Layer 5,6,and 7 on OSI Model

“Layer 4 problem” means a transport layer issue NOT an Application layer issue in TCP/IP 

Encapsulation
Takes the segmented data from each layer and includes it in the next layers data
[Layer 1] ----→ [1][Layer 2] ------→ ..... [1][2][3][4][5][6][Layer 7] (Layer 1-7 becomes a Packet)

Layer 4 breaks large peices of Data into smaller segments
		- Provides HOST to HOST communication

Layer 3 provides connectivity between hosts on Different LAN
		- Provides logical addressing (IP Addresses)
		- Provides path selection between source and destination.
				
Layer 7-5 is called Data
Layer 4 Header makes the data into a Segment
Layer 3 Header makes a segment into a Packet
Layer 2 makes Packets into a FRAME
		- adds a header AND Trailer (Trailer is used for error correction)
Layer 1 does not add anything (only communication medium)

De-Encapsulation
Frame is received and performs the same process in reverse
Layer 2 address (MAC ADDRESS is stripped and trailer is checked for error
Layer 3 address is stripped and stored for return communication
Layer 4 header is removed
Data is presented to application on receiving machine


## Intro to CLI
Jeremy's IT Lab- Video 8:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYbtai7Nu2g&list=PLxbwE86jKRgMpuZuLBivzlM8s2Dk5lXBQ&index=8

CLI = Command Line Interface
				vs.
GUI = Graphical User Interface
 
 Ways to Connect
 - Console Port = RJ-45 to DB-9 cable (called a Rollover cable)
		May need a USB adapter for newer Laptops
				Pin 1 to 8
				Pin 2 to 7
				Pin 3 to 6... etc
		Will need a Terminal Emulator such as PuTTy
		Cisco Default (9600 Baud/ 8 bit/1 stop bit/ no parity/no flow)

## LAN Switching
Jeremy's IT Lab- Video 10:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2n762WG0Vo&list=PLxbwE86jKRgMpuZuLBivzlM8s2Dk5lXBQ&index=10

Physical Layer -
	- Defines physical characteristic of the medium used to tranmit data
	- Includes: voltage levels, maximum transmission distance, connectors, cable specs...
	- Digital Bits are converted into electrical signals (or RADIO for wireless) 
	
Data Link Layer
	- Provides node-to-node connectivity
			- PC to switch
			- Switch to router
			- router to router
	- Defines how Data is formatted for transmission
	- Detects and corrects Physical layer errors
	- Uses MAC addresses (Layer 2 addresses)
	
	
What is a LAN? 
A network contained within a relatively small area 
Routes are used to connect separate LAN's

PDU's
PDU's are the separate sectionsl of the encapsulation process performed by the OSI model. 
Segment + Packet + Frame = PDU

[Data] + [Layer 4 Header] 										= Segment  =  PDU
[Data / L4] + [Layer 3 Header]									= Packet	   =  PDU
Data / L4 / L3] + Layer 2 Header + Layer 2 Trailer 	= Frame	   =  PDU

- Start Frame Delimiter (SFD) - Defines the end of the preamble and the beginning of the actual data being sent
- Frame Check Sequence (FCS) - Check sum that verifies no errors occured

Makeup of an Ethernet Frame
- Preamble = 7 Bytes - 56bits (allows devices to synchronize clocks
- SFD 		   = 1 Byte - 8 bits   ( Delimiter between preamble and message)
- Destination = MAC where the info is being sent (6 Bytes)
- Source 	= MAC where the address is coming from (6 Bytes)
- Type/Length = 2 bytes long - 16 bits
							 <= 1500  =  Length
	  						 >= 1536  =  Protocol (usually ipv4 or ipv6)
- FCS =  4 Bytes 
           - Uses CRC algorithm

Mac Addresses
- 6 Byte - 48 bit unique address assigned to device at manufacture
- a.k.a. Burned in Address (B.I.A.)
- First Half (3 Bytes) describe the manufacturer
- Last Half (3 Bytes) is unique to the device

Hexidecimal
1 - 9  AND a - f
Similar to decimal 
count by 16
1 - 15 single digit
16 = 10 ( 16 + 0)
17 = 11 ( 16 + 1)
26 = 1a ( 16 + 10)
31 = 1f  ( 16 + 15)
255 = ff ( 15 x 16 + 15)

Dynamic MAC Address 
MAC learned via sending (not statically assigned in ARP table)

Known Unicast frame - frame sent to a known host with a known path (only sent to 1 port)
Unknown Unicast frame - frame sent to a known host with an UNKOWN path. similar to broadcast message= sent to all ports (except the sending port) 
		-- Known as flooding		
** Dynamic MAC's are removed after 5 mins of inactivity (called Aging)

PART 2. 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q1pqdmdPjo&list=PLxbwE86jKRgMpuZuLBivzlM8s2Dk5lXBQ&index=11

Minimum size of an ethernet packet = 64Byte
Padding is added to packet if size does not meet Minimums
50 Byte packet + 14 Bytes padding = 64 Byte 

Requires 4 entries:
Source IP = 127.0.0.1 (ex)
Destination IP = 192.168.1.16
Source MAC= abcd.efgh.ijkl
Destination MAC = lkji.hgfe.dcba

ARP - Address Resolution Protocol
finds the Layer 2 address from a known layer 3 address
consists of 2 messages
ARP Request - Broadcast to Everyone (who is abcd? tell dcba)
ARP Reply - Unicast to requester ( Im abcd, my address is abcd.efgh.ijkl)

FFFF.FFFF.FFFF - Broadcast MAC used in ARP requests.

from CLI (Win/ MAC/Linux) Simply type ARP -A to view ARP table

PING
- A network utility used t otest connectivity
- measures the round trip time between destinations
		Uses 2 messages:
		- ICMP Echo Request 
		- ICMP Echo Reply 
Must know MAC address to work




## IPv4 Addressing
Jeremy's IT Lab- Video 13:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ROdsfEUuhs&list=PLxbwE86jKRgMpuZuLBivzlM8s2Dk5lXBQ&index=13

Network Layer
- Provides connectivity between end hosts on different LAN's
- Provides Logical Addressing (IP's)
- Provides Path Selection between source and destination
- Routers operate at layer 3

IP (Internet Protocol) primary method of communication used today
V4 is the version used in most modern networks

IP is 32 bits long
8 bits . 8 bits. 8 bits. 8 bits

Binary works in Base 2 or 2 to the power of X

	Binary 11111111 = 255
	
 128+64+32+16+8+4+2+1 = 255
1 UNIT OF 128 PLUS
1 UNIT OF 64 PLUS
.....

 Binary representation
			
 
 
 Convert decimal to binary
 Subtract in-line
 
   → 221 =
 
			128 	64	32	16	8	4	2	1
			93	28			12	4	0 
			1		1		0		 1		1	1	0	0

		221 = 11011100



		127 = 
		
			128	64	32	16	8	4	2	1
			0		63	31	15	7	3	1	0
			0		1		1		1		1	1	1	1

		127 = 01111111 
		
		
		207  =
			
			128	64	32	16	8	4	2	1	
			79	15	0		0		7	3	1	0	
			1		1		0		0		1	1	1	1
			
		207 = 11001111
		

/24 represents the Network Portion of the IP Address.
 24 bits are allocated to the network
 
 11111111.11111111.11111111.xxxxxxxx
 or 
 192.168.1.0/24 
 
 
 
 127 missing for loopback addesses (127.0.0.0 - 127.255.255.255)
Class D is used for Multicast and Broadcasting
Class E is expirimantal and unused
 
 Longer Network = Fewer Hosts
 
 
 - IP range is usually -2 
 1 for Network ID (usually the .0) and 1 for Broadcast ID (usually .255)
 256 Actually is 254
 
 Netmasks also can define the IP range
 
 255.0.0.0 = /8
 255.255.0.0 = /16
 255.255.255.0  = /24
 
 Part 2: 
 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FiAatRd84XI&list=PLxbwE86jKRgMpuZuLBivzlM8s2Dk5lXBQ&index=14
-- First usable Address is 1 more than Network ID 
-- Last usable Address is 1 less than Nework ID
 

Usable host is found using the 2^x -2 formula
x is equal to the number of host bits

2^8 - 2 = 254
2^16 - 2 = 65,534
2^24 - 2 = 16,777,214

Configuring IP's on a Cisco Device

-- Confirm status of device with the “show ip interface brief ” command
-- type "interface + interface-id" to begin configuring 
-- enter “ip address” followed by the ip and subnet mask to set that interface with the ip
-- type no shutdown to “save” settings
